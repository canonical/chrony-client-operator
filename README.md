A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [subordinate charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/charm/#subordinate)
that deploys and configures Chrony as an NTP client.

Like any Juju charm, it supports one-line deployment, configuration,
integration, scaling, and more. Specifically, the Chrony client charm
can:

* Install Chrony as an NTP client replacing the system default NTP client
* Configure time sources
* Integrate with COS for time tracking status observability

For information on deploying, integrating, and managing this charm, see
the official [Chrony Client documentation](https://charmhub.io/chrony-client).
